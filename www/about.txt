James Langdon has been cutting gems for N years from a small
workshop in Brighton. After experimenting with X and Y he developed
a concave cutting rig to give his work a unique selling point. He is
(as far as is known presently) the only gem cutter (faceter?) making
concave cuts in the South of England.
